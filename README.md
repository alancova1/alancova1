From a young age, software engineer has been my passion I remember using my families desktop computer and being so intrigued with how all these programs can work through this computer. 
My dream of wanting to be a software engineer has been driving me through my education a University of Illinois at Chicago, where I was able to learn new programming languages, and move steps closer to my dream.

As I continue my education I am learning about assembly and GDB, and how to work with the terminal. I would like to be a major software engineer who helps create mobile apps, to help consumers better themselves one day at a time.

Specialties: C, C++, Python.
